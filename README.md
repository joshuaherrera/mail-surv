## Mail-Surv

Mail-Surv is a web application where a user can create surveys to send to recipients as a part of a marketing campaign.

To use:

1. Login with your Google account by clicking "Login with Google"
2. Click "Add Credits" and use the number 4242-4242-4242-4242 to add credits with Stripe's test mode.
3. Create surveys by clicking the red + button on the bottom right.
4. Fill out the form (don't forget recipients)
5. Confirm entries and hit send.

Once a user responds to the survey, a tally of yes or no responses will update on the dashboard.

This web app was created with the help of Udemy's Node with React: Fullstack Web Development course.
